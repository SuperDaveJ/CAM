<p class="term">How do I learn about the various elements of this course?</p>
<p>Select the "Navigation Tutorial" button at the top of the Main Menu screen for a short lesson about how to proceed through the course effectively.</p>

<p class="term">There are many acronyms used in this course.  What do they mean?</p>
<p>Select the "Glossary" button at the left of the screen to launch a popup box containing terms used throughout the course with their definitions.</p>

<p class="term">How do I use the keyboard to navigate the course?</p>
<p>You may use the Internet Explorer default keystrokes, such as Tab and Enter, to maneuver through the course.</p>
<p>Use the appropriate key in your screen reader, if used, to identify the master list of keystrokes it supports.</p>

<p class="term">How do I know if a graphic is selectable?</p>
<p>Selectable graphics are indicated by the use of an orange button.  The cursor will change to a pointing hand when positioned over a selectable or rollover graphic.  Always read the instructions in the prompt area of each page to ensure that you don’t miss any information.</p>

<p class="term">When I click a link or a graphic, nothing happens.  Why?</p>
<p>You may need to set your browser to allow popups in order for some information to appear.  If you are using the Google toolbar in your browser, you may hold the Ctrl key and select the item at the same time, which allows the popup window to open.</p>
<p>In Internet Explorer, you can adjust the settings for blocking popups by selecting Internet Options from the Tools menu, then clicking the Privacy tab.</p>
<p>Many of the graphics in the course are not selectable.  Selectable graphics are indicated by an orange button.  The cursor will also change to a pointing hand when positioned over a selectable or rollover graphic.</p>
<p>If you continue to experience problems, try exiting the course by selecting the “Exit” button.  Then reenter the course.</p>

<p class="term">I want to keep trying the Orientation Check Points until I get the questions right.  How do I do that?</p>
<p>The Orientation Check Points allow only two attempts per question.  After two incorrect responses, you will be provided feedback with the correct answer.  If you would rather not see the correct answer until you arrive at it on your own, select “Refresh” to reset the page after you receive incorrect feedback the first time.</p>

<p class="term">Can I skip Orientation Check Points?</p>
<p>The Orientation Check Points are provided for your benefit so that you may practice the new information in order to learn it more effectively.  You may skip them if you like by selecting the Next button to continue to the next page.</p>
<p>Occasionally, an Orientation Check Point will be in the form of a drill and practice interaction which contains multiple questions.  After you select Start to begin this type of Check Point, you will not be able to select Next until you have either answered all questions correctly or you have attempted each question twice.</p>

<p class="term">How do I find more information about a lesson or topic?</p>
<p>The last page at the end of every mini-course, or module, presents a summary of the topics in that module and a list of resources.  Select the links to access forms, websites, frequently asked questions (FAQs), and other useful information.  The links will open in a new window.</p>

<p class="term">What is the Mentor Message?</p>
<p>A Mentor Message is an opportunity for an experienced CDC employee to mentor you by providing helpful tips and additional information about the topic.  Selecting the Mentor Message icon plays an audio clip.  You may also choose to select “Audio Transcript” to read the text.  If you would like to hear the Mentor Message again, select “Refresh” from the bottom right of the screen.</p>
